THIS IS A GAME, an existance where people play by a set of rules, dynamically defined.

Some will be more concerned with making rules (leaders) and others with following the rules (players). But it's a really a balance of developing the rules of the game and playing the rules of the game. Being a leader at the same time being led. Being an invidual and being apart of something bigger than ones self.
