##The Rules Game

###Preface
(Commentary about the Game from the original authors.)
=======



THIS IS A GAME, an existance where people play by a set of rules, dynamically defined.

Who really enforces the rules these days...Police Brutality is on an up rise nationwide as of Summer 2014



Some will be more concerned with making rules (leaders) and others with following the rules (players). But it's a really a balance of developing the rules of the game and playing the rules of the game. Being a leader at the same time being led. Being an invidual and being apart of something bigger than ones self.
